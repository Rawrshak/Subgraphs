# Rawrshak Graph Node 
The Rawrshak Graph Node repo contains the Rawrshak Subgraph code for The Graph. The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. We will be publishing this subgraph so that others may develop their own front-end applications and access Rawrshak smart contract information for their own games.
